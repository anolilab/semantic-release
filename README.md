## How We Version

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for its versioning providing us an opt-in approach to releases.
This means we add a version number according to the spec, as you see below.
So rather than force developers to consume the latest and greatest, they can choose which version to consume and test any newer ones before upgrading.
Please the read the spec as it goes into further detail.

## Supported Node.js Versions

Libraries in this ecosystem make the best effort to track
[Node.js’ release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). Here’s [a
post on why we think this is important](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/maintainers-should-consider-following-node-js-release-schedule-ab08ed4de71a).
