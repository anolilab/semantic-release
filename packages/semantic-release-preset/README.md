## Purpose

- This configuration also includes a semantic-release configuration, which enables automated GitHub/NPM releases based on your commit messages.

## Install

```bash
npm install --dev-save semantic-release @anolilab/semantic-release-preset
```

```sh
yarn add -D semantic-release @anolilab/semantic-release-preset
```

```sh
pnpm add -D semantic-release @anolilab/semantic-release-preset
```

## Plugins

We use the following plugins within the Semantic Release ecosystem:

- [@semantic-release/changelog][3]
- [@semantic-release/commit-analyzer][1]
- [@semantic-release/exec][5]
- [@semantic-release/git][6]
- [@semantic-release/github][4]
- [@semantic-release/npm][7] (optional)
- [@semantic-release/release-notes-generator][2]
- [@anolilab/semantic-release-pnpm][8] (optional)
- [semantic-release-yarn][9] (optional)

## Summary

This shareable configuration performs the following actions:

1. Analyze commits ([@semantic-release/commit-analyzer][1])
2. Generate changelog content ([@semantic-release/release-notes-generator][2])
3. Create or update a changelog file generated by step 2 ([@semantic-release/changelog][3])
4. Update the package version to the next release version
5. Commit release assets to the project’s git repository with the commit message chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci] ${nextRelease.notes}.
6. Publish a npm release with ([@semantic-release/npm][4] or [@anolilab/semantic-release-pnpm][8] or [semantic-release-yarn][9]) (optional)
7. Publish a GitHub release and comment on released Pull Requests/Issues ([@semantic-release/github][4])

## Usage

When installing this package for the first time, the following shareable configuration `.releaserc.json` is automatically added to your project folder:

> Note: If the script detects an existing `.releaserc.json` file, it will not overwrite it.

> Note: It can happen that the postinstall script don't run, then you have to add the `.releaserc.json` manually.

Npm release with [@semantic-release/npm][4]:

```json
{
    "extends": "@anolilab/semantic-release-preset/npm"
}
```

Npm release with [@anolilab/semantic-release-pnpm][8]:

```json
{
    "extends": "@anolilab/semantic-release-preset/pnpm"
}
```

Npm release with [semantic-release-yarn][9]:

```json
{
    "extends": "@anolilab/semantic-release-preset/yarn"
}
```

Without npm release:

```json
{
    "extends": "@anolilab/semantic-release-preset"
}
```

### deprecation

You want to deprecate old versions of your package?

<details>
<summary>Option one is the semantic-release-npm-deprecate-old-versions</summary>

#### Install

```bash
npm install --dev-save semantic-release-npm-deprecate-old-versions
```

```sh
pnpm add -D semantic-release-npm-deprecate-old-versions
```

```sh
yarn add -D semantic-release-npm-deprecate-old-versions
```

No problem, just add the following to your `.releaserc.json`:

```json
{
    "extends": "@anolilab/semantic-release-preset/npm",
    "plugins": [
        [
            "semantic-release-npm-deprecate-old-versions",

## Environment Variables Configuration

Ensure that your CI configuration has the following environment variables set:

- GITHUB_TOKEN: [A GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
    - When a new release is published, this plugin will try to commit and push into the released branch. Ensure that the user that is running the release has push rights and can bypass branch protection rules.
- NPM_TOKEN: [A npm personal access token](https://www.npmjs.com/package/settings)
    - A NPM token so the package can be published to NPM (a .npmrc file with extra configuration can also be used)

You can test your config with a dry run:

```sh
npx semantic-release --dry-run
```

## GitHub workflows

If you're [configuring a GitHub workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow) you might want to do a test build matrix first and then publish only if those tests succeed across all environments.
The following will do just that, immediately after something is merged into `main`.

Here’s an example workflow configuration that runs your tests and publishes a new version for new commits on `main` branch:

## Note on GitHub protected branches

If you’re releasing a [GitHub protected branch](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) you need to change the git committer to an owner/admin and allow repo admins to bypass the branch protection (make sure "include administrators" is disabled in the branch protection rules.)

If your repo is under an organisation, you can create a bot account and give it admin rights on the repo. If your repo is under a personal account, you have no choice to make the repo owner the commiter for the release.

Either way, you have to create a GitHub personal access token for the committer account and give it the "repo" access rights. Then set it to the GH_TOKEN secret in your GitHub repository.

> Note: GitHub secrets not shared with forks and pull requests, so no one that doesn’t have write access to your repo can use of them.

## Supported Node.js Versions

Libraries in this ecosystem make the best effort to track
[Node.js’ release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). Here’s [a
post on why we think this is important](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/maintainers-should-consider-following-node-js-release-schedule-ab08ed4de71a).
